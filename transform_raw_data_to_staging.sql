/*
This is the file for all raw_data transformations, to make them simple and repeatable.
The scope is to create a staging layer
 - Coalescing the names and FIPS of countries which have drifted over time
 - Adding simple calculated fields to raw data files.
 - Cleaning up data and column names

This does not include the merging of any files together, joins for analytics, etc.
 - Exception, a few demographic files have the identical format across different files, no transformation required.
 - We union those together here and process as one unit.

Some naming conventions
- county_fips: Always rename other FIPS (fips, county_fips_code, etc.) to `county_fips`. Use as first columns for clarity, indexing.
- county_*: Prefix other columns like "name", etc. to specify `county_name`, etc.
